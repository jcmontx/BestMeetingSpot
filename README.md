# BestMeetingSpot
It is an API for finding the best bar to meet within two addresses by distance and time.
I made it because I wanted to go on a date with some girl and I didn't know where it would be 
practical for both of us. After that I got bored and never wrote the client, so feel free to 
use this as you like.
It also uses Swagger/SwaggerUI if you want to play with it a little. So, if you want to write a client you
could just generate the httpclient with autorest :).

# How to use
You have to put your Google Maps Key in the GoogleMapsService class.
